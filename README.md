# Rice Classification using PyTorch ðŸŒ¾ðŸ“Š
This repository contains a deep learning project for classifying different rice varieties using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) implemented in PyTorch and TensorFlow. The dataset includes five types of rice: Arborio, Basmati, Ipsala, Jasmine, and Karacadag.


## ðŸ“¦ Dataset
The dataset used in this project is available on my Kaggle page:    
ðŸ‘‰ [Rice Images Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mbsoroush/rice-images-dataset)


## ðŸ“Œ Features
- Dataset Preprocessing: Splitting images into train, validation, and test sets.
- Data Augmentation: Applied transformations such as resizing, flipping, and rotation.
- CNN Models: Two different CNN architectures implemented and evaluated.
- Training & Optimization: Trained using cross-entropy loss and Adam optimizer.
- Model Evaluation: Accuracy, confusion matrices, and classification reports generated.
- Visualization: Model performance plotted using training history and predictions.
